# rutcellars-issues
R√ºt Cellars mobile app is helping farms and households reduce their waste of foods. With R√ºt Cellars, farms and households monitor the conditions of their food storage locations and optimize those conditions for the stored foods. This is an issues-only repository for tracking bug reports from the community. üêõ

The goal of this tracker is to report bugs that our team can reproduce. Sometimes, there's a lot going on in projects - and we're not able to reproduce the issue outside of your project. For issues that are project-specific, we may redirect you to support. If you think that it's specific to your project configuration, please reach out to our support team.

For suggestions about features and enhancements, please add your feedback using the feedback form in the product.
